## 第二部分：榜样 (Role Model)

### 2.0 我的榜样：李文亮医生 (Dr. Li Wenliang)

> **Response:** My role model is Dr. Li Wenliang. I especially admire his courage to **speak the truth independently**. Even when facing immense pressure, he insisted on alerting the public about the danger. His commitment to the facts reminds me that staying true to one's conscience is the highest form of bravery.

In my view, toxic people use their influence to suppress different voices. In contrast, a charismatic person like Dr. Li uses his voice to protect others, even at great personal risk. That is the true difference between manipulation and inspiration.

### 3.2 关于星座 (Horoscopes & Barnum Effect)

### 5.1 & 5.2 什么是文本？ (Definition of Text)
