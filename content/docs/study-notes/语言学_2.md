**Cognitive Linguistics（认知语言学）** is an approach that views language as an integral part of general human cognition rather than an autonomous faculty. It argues that linguistic structure reflects the mapping of conceptual structures and embodied experiences.(Gemini)
**Cognitive Linguistics** is based on human experiences of the world and the way they perceive and conceptualize the world. (Textbook)
2,
**Psycholinguistics（心理语言学）** is the study of the mental processes and cognitive faculties involved in the acquisition, production, and comprehension of language. It investigates how the human brain processes linguistic information in real-time and stores it in memory.(Gemini)
**Psycholinguistics** is the study of psychological aspects of language; it usually studies the psychological states and mental activity associated with the use of language.(Textbook)
3,
**Language Acquisition（语言获取）** is the process by which humans develop the ability to perceive, produce, and use words to communicate. It focuses on how children naturally acquire their first language (**FLA**) through innate mechanisms and social interaction without formal instruction.(Gemini)
4,
**Stages of Language Acquisition** includes 4 parts:
	1,Holophrastic stage: try to control the speech muscle, single word
	2,Two-word stage: primitive syntax begins, with two-word strings
	3,Stage of Three-word Utterances: samples drawn from longer potential sentences expressing a complete and complicated idea
	4,Fluent Grammatical Conversation Stage: complete
5,
**Construal Operations** are the cognitive processes by which speakers choose to perceive and portray a specific scene in a particular way. They allow the same objective situation to be described differently based on factors. (Gemini)
**Construal（识解）** is the ability to conceive and portray the same situation in alternate way through specificity, different mental scanning, etc. (Textbook)
6,
**Categorization（分类，范畴化）** is the process of classifying our experiences into different categories based on commonalities and differences. (Textbook)
	includes basic level(小类,dog), superordinate level(大类,animal), subordinate level(个体,alaskan)
7,
**Image Schema** means a recurring dynamic pattern of our perceptual interactions and motor programs that gives coherence and structure to our experience. (Textbook)
8,
**Conceptual Metaphor** is the understanding of one conceptual domain (the **target domain**) in terms of another, typically more concrete, domain (the **source domain**).（联想）
	Time is Money.
**Conceptual Metonymy** is a cognitive process where one conceptual entity (the **vehicle**) provides mental access to another entity (the **target**) within the **same conceptual domain** or Idealized Cognitive Model (ICM). （部分代整体）
	The White House issued a statement.

1,
***Anthropological Linguistics（人类语言学）*** is the study of language within the broader context of culture and its role in shaping social identity and worldviews. It explores how linguistic practices both reflect and influence a community’s beliefs, social structures, and cultural heritage. (Gemini)（语言如何反映一个民族的世界观？文化习俗如何影响语言的选择和演变？
语言如何在社会交际中传达文化意义？）
2,
***Theory of Context of Situation*** can be described as:
	a. the relevant features of the participants, persons, personalities:（参与者的相关特征）
		1, the verbal action of the participants
		2, the non-verbal action of the participants
	b. the relevant objects（相关物体）
	c. the effects of the verbal action（言语行为的效果）
	总结：人，物，结果
3,
***Speech Community*** refers to a group of people who "share not only the same rules of speaking, but at least one linguistic variety as well" (Textbook)
4,
***Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis*** suggests is that our language helps mold our way of thinking and different languages may probably express speakers' unique way of understanding the world. (Textbook)
	有两种理论，强相关与弱相关。
	强相关认为语言决定思想，弱相关认为语言影响思想。

What you should be fully aware of to do a good job in ***Cross-Cultural Communication*** :
	1, ecological
	2, linguistic
	3, religious
	4, material
	5, social
6,
***Culture in Language Teaching Classroom***
at least three objectives:
	1, get the students familiar with cultural differences（熟悉文化差异）
	2, help the students transcend their own culture and learn to view things as the members of the target culture will.（超越母语文化，学会换位思考）
	3, show the strong linking between language and culture through classroom activities.（展现语言与文化的紧密关联）
7,
***Sociolinguistics*** is the study of how language and society interact with each other. It examines the way languages is used in different social groups, communities and so on. (From the slides the teacher provided)
	
	语言变异 (Variation),语言在不同群体中呈现出的不同形式。,变体 (Variety / Lect)、方言 (Dialect)
	语言功能 (Function),语言在社会中扮演什么角色？,语域 (Register)、代码切换 (Code-switching)
	语言态度 (Attitude),人们如何看待不同的语言？,威望 (Prestige)、语言偏见 (Bias)
8,
**Dialect** is a systematic variety of a language used by a particular group, distinguished by unique features in **vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation**. (Gemini)
# Chapter 9
***Stylistics*** is a branch of linguistics which studies the features of situationally distinctive uses of language, and tries to establish principles capable of accounting for the particular choices made by individual and social groups in their use of language.（情景差异、语言特征、选择原则）
***Foregrounding*** is defined as "artistically motivated deviation".
***Figurative Language*** a use of language that deviates from literal meaning to achieve a special effect or deeper understanding. It employs **literary devices** (such as metaphor, simile, and personification) to create vivid imagery, emphasize ideas, or establish emotional connections by linking unrelated concepts through imaginative association.(Gemini)
***The Form of Sound Pattering***
	本质是"韵脚"的概念
	种类如下:
	1, Rhyme
	2, Alliteration
	3, Assonance
	4, Consonance
	5, Reverse Rhyme
	6, Pararhyme
	7, Repetition
# Chapter 10
***Computational Linguistics*** is an interdisciplinary field concerned with statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective.
***Computer Literacy(赛博识字率)*** refer to those people who have sufficient knowledge and skill in the use of computer and computer software.
***CALL(Computer-Assisted Language Learning)*** refers to the use of a computer in the teaching or learning of a second or foreign language.
***MOOC*** is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. MOOCs provide interactive user forums to support community interactions among students, professors and teaching assistants.
***Corpus(语料库)*** is a collection of data, either compiled as written texts or as a transcription of recorded speech.
***Corpus Linguistics*** deals with the principles and practices of using corpora in language study. A computer corpus is a large body of machine-readable texts.
# Chapter 11
***Applied Linguistics*** is an interdisciplinary field of study that identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-world problems. It integrates linguistic theory with other disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, and education—to address issues like language teaching, translation, speech therapy, and language policy. (Gemini)

***Input Hypothesis*** is a central concept in Stephen Krashen’s Second Language Acquisition theory, which posits that learners acquire language by processing **"comprehensible input"** at a level slightly beyond their current proficiency (defined as $i + 1$). It emphasizes that acquisition is driven by understanding messages rather than by deliberate study of grammar or rote memorization. (Gemini)

***Interlanguage*** refers to the type of language constructed by second or foreign language learners who are still in the process of learning a language.

***Communicative  Competence*** refers to what a learner knows about how a language is used in particular situations for effective and appropriate communication.

***Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT)*** A teaching approach that focuses on the use of authentic language and on asking students to complete meaningful **tasks** using the target language. In this framework, language is acquired through the process of achieving a goal rather than through the explicit study of grammatical structures. Success is measured by the **completion of the task** rather than the accuracy of the language used.(Gemini)

****Curriculum*** The overall philosophy, goals, and structure of an educational program. It covers everything from the learning philosophy and assessment methods to the social and emotional goals of a school or an entire educational system. It answers the question: **"Why are we teaching this, and what kind of person are we trying to shape?"**

***Syllabus*** A detailed document that outlines the specific topics, readings, and assignments to be covered in a particular course. It acts as a contract between the teacher and the students, specifying the "what" and "when" of a single subject. It answers the question: **"What will be covered in this specific class?"**(Gemini)

***Contrastive Analysis*** is a way of comparing languages in order to determine potential errors for the ultimate purpose of isolating what needs to be learned and what does need to be learned in a second language learning situation.

***Error Analysis*** is a methodology in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) that involves collecting, identifying, describing, and explaining the errors made by language learners. Unlike Contrastive Analysis, which tries to predict errors based on language differences, EA focuses on analyzing the actual output of learners to understand their **internal learning process** and development.(Gemini)
