### 1.1
Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I would describe myself as an **independent thinker** and a **maverick**; I value mental freedom and always form my own opinions. Recently, I achieved a personal milestone by finishing my first **screenplay**. My goal is to be a global citizen who stays true to the facts and lives an authentic life.
### 1.2 Qualities/Attitudes for your profession:
"As a future language professional, I need patience, cultural empathy, and adaptability. A positive attitude toward lifelong learning is essential to master both language and pedagogy."
### 1.2
"I didn't start as an English major; I actually transferred from History during my sophomore year. English has always been my strongest suit and my greatest passion. I realized this major fits my strengths much better, so I decided to make the change to pursue what I truly love."
### 1.3
I rely on to-do lists to manage my schedule. By listing every assignment and lecture, I ensure that nothing gets missed despite the heavy workload of our course requirements. This helps me stay focused and meet every deadline effectively.
### 1.5
My proudest achievement is finally finishing a screenplay I’ve been dreaming about since high school. Although I procrastinated for years, I finally sat down and completed the writing recently. It feels amazing to give a proper ending to my younger self’s vision and turn that old idea into reality.
### 1.7
My dream is to become a global citizen with a wide vision. This goal motivates me to keep exploring different cultures and expanding my understanding of the world every day.
### 1.9
I handle stress by 'talking to myself on paper.' I write down my thoughts to clear my mind and reorganize my plans. It helps me stay calm and regain control.
### 1.15
I value constructive criticism and treat logical advice as a chance to improve. However, I ignore baseless finger-pointing or emotional venting. I believe such negativity is just a waste of time and energy.
### 1.15
Beyond meeting my basic living needs, I consider a salary appropriate if it allows me to explore the things I'm passionate about. I value a position that supports both my lifestyle and my personal growth.
### 1.16
A great day for me is being left alone to focus on my tasks. I love having the space to complete my work without any interruptions or unnecessary meetings. That is when I'm most productive.
### 1.19
My family would describe me as a bit of a maverick. In terms of personality, I don’t really share any similarities with them, and there's almost no trace of their influence on my character. I'm quite independent.

### 1.5 薪水预期 (Salary Expectation)

> **Response:** Beyond meeting my basic living needs, I consider a salary appropriate if it allows me to explore the things I'm passionate about. I value a position that supports both my lifestyle and my personal growth.

### 1.16 理想的工作日 (Great Day at Work)

## 第三部分：性格类型 (Personality Types)

### 3.2 关于星座 (Horoscopes & Barnum Effect)

> **Response:** In my opinion, horoscopes are a form of **pseudo-science**. They rely on the **Barnum Effect**, where people believe vague personality descriptions are tailored specifically for them. I treat it as a cultural phenomenon for entertainment, rather than a guide for my life decisions.

## 第五部分：文本的概念 (Notion of TEXT)

### 5.1 & 5.2 什么是文本？ (Definition of Text)

> **Response:** I define a TEXT as any system of signs that carries meaning, including architecture or clothes. People interpret the same text differently because they use different 'cultural codes' to decode it. Our personal experiences act like filters.

## 第八部分：绘画作为文本 (Painting as TEXT)

### 8.0 梵高《星空》 (The Starry Night)

> **Response:** I’d like to discuss Van Gogh's _The Starry Night_. As a 'text,' this painting communicates his inner world. The turbulent sky 'speaks' of his mental struggle, while the bright stars represent hope. It shows how visual symbols convey feelings that words cannot express.

## 第十部分：本学期难忘的事 (A Remarkable Event)

### 10.0 挽救生命 (Saving a Life)

> **Response:** The most remarkable event this semester was when I had to talk a student out of committing suicide. He was in a very dark place, and I provided psychological support to help him reconnect with reality.
> I was terrified because I knew that **actions speak louder than words**. I stayed by his side because **a friend in need is a friend indeed**. Thankfully, he is now back to his normal life. It taught me that **where there is life, there is hope**.
